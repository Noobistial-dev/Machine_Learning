Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed for every task.
Instead of writing detailed rules for how to do something, we give the machine lots of examples, and it figures out the rules on its own.

ðŸ”§ How It Works (Simplified Steps):
Collect Data : Example- A list of house prices along with their features (size, number of bedrooms, location).

Train a Model: The algorithm looks for patterns and relationships in the data.

Make Predictions: Once trained, the model can predict the price of a new house it has never seen before.

Improve Over Time: With more data and feedback, the model can become more accurate.

ðŸŽ¯ Types of Machine Learning:
| Type                       | What It Does                                      | Example                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Supervised Learning**    | Learns from labeled data                          | Spam detection, house price prediction          |
| **Unsupervised Learning**  | Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data           | Customer segmentation, topic modeling           |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Learns through trial and error by getting rewards | Self-driving cars, game-playing AI like AlphaGo |

ðŸš— Real-World Example: Self-Driving Cars
A self-driving car uses machine learning to:

-> Detect pedestrians and traffic signs (from image data)

-> Predict what nearby cars will do

-> Decide when to accelerate, brake, or turn

It learns these behaviors by analyzing massive amounts of labeled driving data and improving over time.

ðŸ§© Key Idea:
Instead of telling the machine how to solve a problem, we show it examples and let it learn the solution.
